This plugin is designed to handle the broken images that might appear on the posts on your blog.

== Description ==

This plugin is designed to &#8220;<em>fight</em>&#8221; the broken images on 
your WordPress powered site. It works by inserting a JavaScript snippet in the 
output HTML code of your pages, which attaches itself to the 
<em>onError=".."</em> events of the images, so if an image fails to 
load, this JS snippet is fired. You can customize what actions you want to 
perform on the broken images: hide them, style-them, replace them, etc - all 
this from the WordPress admin panel.

== Installation ==

1. Download the installation archive and uncompress
1. Upload the unarchived folder to your plugins directory (this is wp-content/plugins/)
1. Activate the plugin in your WordPress administration panel (this is the Plugins page)
1. Configure the plugin from the Options page in the WordPress administration panel
1. That’s it ;)
